# ⚾ MLB AI Exercise: Analyzing Baseball Stats with ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini (on Raspberry Pi 5)

This project explores how different AI tools analyze Major League Baseball trends using historical data. We compare the capabilities of **ChatGPT**, **Perplexity**, **Claude**, and **Gemini**—running everything on a **Raspberry Pi 5**. 📊🧠

## 🎯 What This Project Covers

We asked each AI model to analyze long-term MLB data and generate Python code to visualize:

- **Stolen Base Trends** (by team and decade)
- **Pitcher Strikeout Trends** (NL vs. AL, per year and decade)

Each AI was evaluated on:
- Ability to understand the dataset
- Quality of insights
- Generated visualizations
- Python code execution on a Raspberry Pi 5
